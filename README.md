# itec-plans
a landing place for dependency graphs

We use graphviz to convert our course dependency chains in different ITEC tracks to directed graphs

# Steps
Generate directed graphs with:

$ cd AY19-20
$ dot -Tpdf SoftwareDevelopment.dot -o outputs/SoftwareDevelopment.pdf
$ dot -Tpdf SoftwareDevelopment.dot -o outputs/SoftwareDevelopment.pdf
$ dot -Tpdf SoftwareDevelopment.dot -o outputs/SoftwareDevelopment.pdf
$ dot -Tpdf SoftwareDevelopment.dot -o outputs/SoftwareDevelopment.pdf
$ dot -Tpdf SoftwareDevelopment.dot -o outputs/SoftwareDevelopment.pdf

or simply

$ cd AY19-20
$ ./build.zsh

Please see the 'outputs' folder for the generated graphs
